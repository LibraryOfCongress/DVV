# Digital Viewer and Validator (DVV)

The Digital Viewer and Validator (DVV) is a tool developed at the Library of Congress (LC) for use by [National Digital Newspaper Program (NDNP)](https://www.loc.gov/ndnp/) staff, awardee institutions (originators of newspaper content), and vendors to allow viewing of NDNP data and validation of select technical aspects of the files. It includes validation processing that can be run from a DOS command line or the DVV’s own Windows Graphical User Interface (GUI). The DVV also allows visual inspection of NDNP image files, and viewing of OCR, image headers, and other metadata.

NDNP is a partnership between the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) and the Library of Congress (LC) to create a national digital resource of historically significant newspapers published between 1690 and 1963, from all the states and U.S. jurisdictions. Institutions wishing to participate in the NDNP should consult the [NEH Application Guidelines](https://www.neh.gov/grants/preservation/national-digital-newspaper-program) for information regarding the NEH’s annual solicitation of proposals for participation in the program.
